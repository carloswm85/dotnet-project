## MAIN STEPS
1. Write down all features and benefits in the project.
2. Take off those items from point 1, and divide those up into **1 week sprints**. Eg: What can I do in 5 days?
3. Track progress (divide the project up into bite-sized components):
   1. DOs:
      1. Aim to things you can accomplish.
      2. Detail what it needs to be done.
      3. Keep up with deadlines.
      4. Take note of threats, opportunities, strengths and weaknesses ([SWOT Analysis](https://www.google.com/search?q=threats+opportunities+strengths+and+weaknesses)).
      5. Keep doing sprint iterations.
      6. Check off finished work.
   2. DON'Ts:
      1. Avoid rabbit holes: I need to do this now and that then... I need to learn that... etc.
3. Use the "Bug/Issue Tracker" project to track the progress I am doing in the project.
4. Show in the interview the bug tracker with the progress I made while building it. This is next level.
